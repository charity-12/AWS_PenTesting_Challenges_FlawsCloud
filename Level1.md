# AWS Penetration Testing Challenge - Flaws Site

## Level 1: Finding the First Subdomain

1. Ran `nslookup flaws.cloud` to obtain information about the domain.
2. Ran `host flaws.cloud` to find the IP address associated with the domain.
3. Ran `host 52.92.232.67` to determine that the IP address is hosted on AWS and got the output(`s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`).
4. Ran `aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud/ --no-sign-request --region us-west-2` to list objects in the S3 bucket.
5. Identified the presence of a secret file: `secret-dd02c7c.html`.

## Exploiting the Secret File

1. Accessed the secret file by browsing the S3 bucket at `flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/secret-dd02c7c.html`.
2. Successfully obtained the congratulations message.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Domain Enumeration and DNS Queries
   - Utilized `nslookup` and `host` commands to gather information about the target domain, revealing the importance of domain enumeration in reconnaissance.

### 2. AWS S3 Bucket Enumeration
   - Leveraged the AWS CLI to list objects within an S3 bucket, emphasizing the significance of verifying S3 bucket configurations and permissions.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure Discovery
   - Resolved the target's IP address to an AWS domain, highlighting the relevance of understanding the underlying infrastructure.

### 4. Exploitation and Verification
   - Successfully accessed and exploited a secret file, showcasing the impact of misconfigurations in S3 bucket settings.

These lessons contribute to a foundational understanding of penetration testing, ethical hacking, and AWS security. As I progress, I will build on these lessons to explore more advanced scenarios and enhance my skills further. Continuous learning and staying updated on security best practices will be valuable in my journey in the field of cybersecurity.
