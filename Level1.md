# AWS Penetration Testing Challenge - Flaws Site

## Level 1: Finding the First Subdomain

1. Ran `nslookup flaws.cloud` to obtain information about the domain.
2. Ran `host flaws.cloud` to find the IP address associated with the domain.
3. Ran `host 52.92.232.67` to determine that the IP address is hosted on AWS and got the output(`s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`).
4. Ran `aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud/ --no-sign-request --region us-west-2` to list objects in the S3 bucket.
5. Identified the presence of a secret file: `secret-dd02c7c.html`.

## Exploiting the Secret File

1. Accessed the secret file by browsing the S3 bucket at `flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/secret-dd02c7c.html`.
2. Successfully obtained the congratulations message.
